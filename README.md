# Hi👋  

🔐 Offensive Security Consultant    

I work in offensive security, red teaming, and vulnerability discovery helping organizations understand their real attack surface and strengthen their defenses.  
I also enjoy breaking down security concepts, running phishing simulations, and creating training material that helps people stay a little safer online 😉

When I'm not testing environments or writing reports, you’ll usually find me exploring new attack techniques, researching tooling, or sharing security insights.

## 🌱 Currently working on
- Red teaming & full-scope security assessments  
- Phishing simulations and awareness training  
- Bug bounty research & disclosure reports  
- Security tooling & automation experiments
